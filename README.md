This Sales Dashboard for 2023 provides a comprehensive overview of sales performance, comparing it against the previous year (2022). At the top, it displays key performance indicators (KPIs) including Total Sales, Total Profit, and Total Quantity, along with their year-over-year growth percentages and monthly trends for both 2023 and 2022. The dashboard further breaks down performance by product subcategory, showing a comparison of 2023 and 2022 sales alongside a view of 2023 profit and loss for each subcategory. Finally, it presents weekly trends for sales and profit in 2023, highlighting performance against the average weekly values. The dashboard is designed to facilitate the analysis of sales trends, identify top and bottom performers, and understand overall business growth in the current year compared to the last.
