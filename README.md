## Project Background
Rainbow Retail, a domestic retail company, specializes in selling office, furniture and electronic goods. I am patnering with the Head of Operations to extract insights and deliver actionable insights to improve performance across sales and marketing teams.

## Executive Summary
Rainbow Retail experienced a strong year in 2023 with a **20.4% increase** in **Total Sales** to $733K, a **14.2% rise** in **Total Profit** to $93K, and a substantial **26.8%** growth in **Total Quantity** sold to 12K units. **Sales peaked** in the **second and third quarters**, with **November** achieving the **highest monthly sales at $118K**, a 49.2% year-over-year increase. However, a notable concern is the 13.6% sales decline from November to December 2023, diverging from the previous year's upward trend. The top sales drivers were Phones, Chairs, and Binders, while **Binders led in profitability**. Conversely, **Tables** and Machines were the **primary loss-making product** subcategories, indicating areas requiring strategic attention.

This Sales Dashboard for 2023 provides a comprehensive overview of sales performance, comparing it against the previous year (2022). At the top, it displays key performance indicators (KPIs) including Total Sales, Total Profit, and Total Quantity, along with their year-over-year growth percentages and monthly trends for both 2023 and 2022. The dashboard further breaks down performance by product subcategory, showing a comparison of 2023 and 2022 sales alongside a view of 2023 profit and loss for each subcategory. Finally, it presents weekly trends for sales and profit in 2023, highlighting performance against the average weekly values. The dashboard is designed to facilitate the analysis of sales trends, identify top and bottom performers, and understand overall business growth in the current year compared to the last.

## Business Recommendations
### Sales Team

1. **Focus on Q2 & Q3 Performance Drivers**: The significant sales peaks starting from August of 2023, showing substantial growth compared to 2022, indicate a **strong performance** in **second and third quater**. The 
   Sales team should analyze the specific factors contributing to this success (e.g., promotions, seasonal demand, sales strategies implemented) and identify replicable tactics for future Q4 periods. Conversely, 
   investigate the dips in sales observed in months like February, to understand potential seasonal slowdowns or areas needing strategic adjustments throughout the year.

2. **Optimize Profitability of Key Product Lines**: While **"Phones"** lead in sales revenue, **"Chairs"** and **"Copiers"** appear to be strong profit drivers in 2023. The Sales team should explore opportunities to 
   **increase the sales volume of these high-profit subcategories** through targeted sales efforts or promotions. Simultaneously, a **critical review** of the sales strategy and pricing for the loss-making subcategories 
   like **"Tables"** and **"Machines"** is necessary to identify opportunities for cost reduction, pricing adjustments, or revised sales approaches to improve their profitability.
   
3. **Monitor and Act on Weekly Performance Trends**: The weekly sales and profit trends for 2023 provide a granular view of performance. The Sales team should actively monitor weeks that consistently fall below the average 
   for both sales and profit. Investigate the reasons behind these underperforming weeks and implement immediate corrective actions or targeted sales initiatives. Conversely, understanding the factors contributing to 
   consistently above-average weeks can help identify and replicate successful sales strategies on an ongoing basis.

### Marketing Team

1. **Leverage High-Performing Product Categories in Campaigns**: The consistent growth in sales for **"Phones," "Chairs," and "Binders"** from 2022 to 2023 highlights **strong customer demand**. The Marketing team should 
   **prioritize** these product subcategories in upcoming marketing campaigns, focusing on highlighting their value proposition, attracting new customers, and encouraging repeat purchases. Consider developing targeted 
   advertising, content marketing, or promotional bundles around these popular items.
   
2. **Strategically Plan for Seasonal Sales Peaks**: The pronounced sales spikes in **Q2** and **Q3** in 2023 indicate a significant seasonal trend or the success of specific end-of-year marketing initiatives. The 
   Marketing team should proactively plan campaigns and promotions well in advance for these key periods, leveraging insights from the drivers of last year's success to maximize impact and sales during these high-potential 
   months.
   
3. **Address Underperforming Subcategories with Targeted Strategies**: The negative profit margins in **"Tables"** and **"Machines"** in 2023 signal a need for focused marketing attention. The Marketing team should 
   collaborate with the Sales and Product teams to understand the underlying reasons for this underperformance (e.g., pricing, customer perception, market trends). Based on this understanding, develop targeted marketing 
   strategies, such as promotional offers, highlighting unique features, or exploring new market segments, to stimulate demand and improve the profitability of these challenged product lines.
